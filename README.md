In this project, I led the development of a sophisticated simulation for a robotic vacuum within the Gazebo environment, seamlessly integrated with ROS to ensure both functionality and realism. The main part of the project was the design and configuration of a URDF file, detailing the physical and functional attributes of the robot. This encompassed the integration of crucial sensors, including a 2D LiDAR, a depth camera, and an IMU, each vital for the robot's interaction with its simulated surroundings. Finally, the implementation of a twist_mux node, effectively managed multiple input commands. This ensured the robot's decision-making process was robust and adaptive, guaranteeing optimal performance in various simulated scenarios.
